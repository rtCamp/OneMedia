## Overview

OneMedia, part of the [OnePress](https://rtcamp.com/onepress/) suite, is a centralized media library for multi-brand enterprises using WordPress. It allows a central **Governing Site** to manage and distribute media assets to any number of connected **Brand Sites**, streamlining your workflow and ensuring brand consistency.

---

## Features

### Core Functionality

OneMedia enables you to share media from a central Governing Site to your network of Brand Sites. You can share assets using two distinct modes: Sync and Non-Sync.

> **Note:** Supported file types are JPG, PNG, WEBP, BMP, SVG, and GIF.

#### Sync Mode
When an asset is shared in **Sync Mode**, a live link is maintained between the Governing Site and the Brand Sites. Any updates made on the Governing Site—from metadata changes to file replacements—are automatically synchronized across all Brand Sites where the asset has been shared.

#### Non-Sync Mode
In **Non-Sync Mode**, a copy of the media asset is sent to the Brand Sites and remains static. Shared assets cannot be deleted on Brand Sites; however, non-synced assets can be edited independently on each site.

### Key Features & Benefits

-   **Time Efficiency:** Upload assets once and distribute them everywhere, eliminating redundant work.
-   **Brand Consistency:** Ensure all websites in your network display the latest, approved brand assets.
-   **Flexibility:** Choose between Sync Mode for live updates or Non-Sync Mode for one-time sharing.
-   **Centralized Control:** Assets shared in Sync Mode are read-only on Brand Sites, preventing unauthorized edits and ensuring brand integrity.
-   **File Replacement:** Easily replace a synced media file on the Governing Site, and the update will propagate across all connected Brand Sites automatically.
-   **Secure Communication:** Brand Sites generate unique API keys to ensure all communication with the Governing Site is secure and authorized.

---

### Site Types

-   **Governing Site:** The central WordPress installation that controls all media sharing and synchronization. A single Governing Site can connect to multiple Brand Sites.
-   **Brand Site:** A managed WordPress site that receives shared media. A Brand Site can connect to only one Governing Site at a time.

### Governing Site Options

#### Managing Brand Site Connections

1.  **Add a Brand Site:**
    -   Navigate to **OneMedia → Settings** on the Governing Site.
    -   Click **Add Brand Site** and enter the following details:
        -   **Site Name:** A descriptive name for the Brand Site (max 20 characters).
        -   **Site URL:** The full URL of the Brand Site.
        -   **API Key:** The unique API key generated on the Brand Site.
    -   Click **Add Site** to complete the connection.

2.  **Update or Remove a Brand Site:**
    -   From the **OneMedia → Settings** page, click the **edit icon** to update a site's details or the **delete icon** to remove it.

#### Managing and Sharing Media

1.  **Share Media with Brand Sites:**
    -   Navigate to **OneMedia → Media Sharing** on the Governing Site.
    -   Select the **Sync Media** or **Non-Sync Media** tab based on your needs.
    -   Click **Add to Sync Media** or **Add to Non-Sync Media** to open the media library.
    -   Select the assets you wish to share and click the **Share Selected Media** button.
    -   In the pop-up modal, choose the destination Brand Sites and click **Share Media**.

    > **Note:** The **Non-Sync Media** tab is pre-populated with existing assets from your WordPress Media Library.

2.  **Update Synced Media Metadata:**
    -   In the **Sync Media** tab, click the **edit icon** next to any asset.
    -   Update the title, caption, alt text, or description and click **Update**. The changes will automatically apply to all connected Brand Sites.

3.  **Replace a Synced Media File:**
    -   Click the **edit icon** next to the relevant asset.
    -   In the edit modal, scroll down and click the **Replace Media** button.
    -   Upload the new file. Once complete, click **Update**. The new file will replace the old one across all Brand Sites where it was shared.

### Brand Site Options

#### API Key Management

-   **Regenerate an API Key:** On the Brand Site, navigate to **OneMedia → Settings** and click **Regenerate API Key**. The previous key will be invalidated, so remember to update it on the Governing Site.
-   **Disconnect from Governing Site:** Click **Disconnect from Governing Site** to sever the connection. This will stop all future media synchronization but will not delete any assets already shared to the Brand Site.

## Known Issues / Limitations

1.  **Supported Files:** Only JPG, PNG, WEBP, BMP, SVG, and GIF files are supported.
2.  **Deleting Synced Media:** Media shared in **Sync Mode** cannot be deleted directly from the Governing Site. To delete a synced asset, or any shared asset from a Brand Site, you must first disable the OneMedia plugin and then perform the deletion.
3.  **API Save Delay:** Due to a WordPress REST API issue, metadata updates for Sync Media may occasionally fail to save on the first attempt. If you encounter this, please refresh the page and try updating again.
4.  **Image Replacement Sizing:** The media replacement feature for synced assets does not currently validate image dimensions. Replacing an image with one of a different size may affect its appearance on the front end.
5.  **Subdirectory Multisite Limitation:** On a subdirectory multisite installation, a Brand Site can only be connected to a Governing Site that exists within the same multisite network.
6.  **Subdomain Multisite Limitation:** Subdomain multisite installations have not been fully tested.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How does media sharing work?
Media is uploaded once to the Governing Site and can then be distributed to any connected Brand Site in either Sync or Non-Sync Mode.

### Can I control which sites receive specific assets?
Yes. When you share media, you can select the specific Brand Sites you want to send it to.

### What's the difference between Sync and Non-Sync Modes?
-   **Sync Mode:** Creates a live link. Changes on the Governing Site are automatically pushed to Brand Sites. Ideal for critical brand assets like logos.
-   **Non-Sync Mode:** Sends a one-time copy. The asset can be edited independently on the Brand Site. Ideal for sharing a batch of images for a campaign.

### How do I add a new Brand Site?
On the Governing Site, go to **OneMedia → Settings**, click **Add Brand Site**, and fill in the site's name, URL, and API key.

### How can I check an asset's sync status?
-   On the **Governing Site**, the **OneMedia → Media Sharing** screen displays a sync status badge on each asset.
-   On a **Brand Site**, the WordPress Media Library shows a "SYNCED" status icon (in grid view) or a "Sync Status" column (in list view).

### Can I edit or delete shared media on a Brand Site?
You can **edit** the metadata of non-synced media. You **cannot delete** any media (Sync or Non-Sync) that was shared from a Governing Site.

### My media share is failing. What should I do?
First, ensure the API key is correct and the Brand Site is reachable. You can test the connection by navigating to **OneMedia → Settings** on the Governing Site, clicking "Edit" next to the Brand Site, adding a `/` after the URL, and clicking "Update Site". If a connection problem exists, an error message will appear.

### Does this work on a multisite network?
Yes, OneMedia supports Subdirectory multisite and standard WordPress installations. As of now, Subdomain multisite installations have not been fully tested.

### I accidentally set the incorrect site type during activation. How do I fix it?
You must uninstall and then reinstall the plugin, selecting the correct site type during reactivation. **Note:** Uninstalling removes OneMedia settings but leaves your media files intact.

### Is this secure?
Yes. All communication between sites is authenticated using unique API keys and validated requests.
