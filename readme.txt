== Description ==

* **Sync Media Replacement:** In addition to updating metadata, you can also replace the actual media file for assets shared in Sync Mode.
* **Delete Prevention:** Media shared from the Governing Site cannot be deleted on the Brand Site. It's management is handled from the Governing Site only.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does media sharing work? =

Media is uploaded once to the Governing Site and can be shared or synced to any connected Brand Site.

= Can I control which sites receive specific assets? =

Yes, you can select target sites when sharing media.

= What is the difference between Sync and Non-Sync Modes? =

* **Sync Mode:** Assets are kept up-to-date across all Brand Sites. Metadata changes or asset replacements on the Governing Site are automatically reflected on Brand Sites.
* **Non-Sync Mode:** Assets are shared once and not updated automatically. The idea is to be able to share multiple assets with multiple Brand Sites in one go.

= How do I add a new Brand Site? =

Go to **OneMedia → Settings**, click "Add Brand Site", and add the Brand Site details. Click on "Add Site" to register the Brand Site with the Governing Site.

= How do I check if media is synced? =

* On the Governing Site, go to **OneMedia → Media Sharing** and open the **Sync Media** tab. The Sync status is shown for each media asset and the tooltip shows which sites it's shared with.
* On the Brand Site, go to **WordPress Media Library** and you can check the **Sync Status** column in list Mode. In the grid Mode, you can check the Sync status icon on each media asset haveing title "SYNCED".

= Can I edit or delete shared media on Brand Sites? =

* Edit: You can edit the metadata of Non-Sync media on Brand Sites. However, changes made to the media on the Brand Site will not be reflected on the Governing Site.
* Delete: You cannot delete shared media on Brand Sites.

= My media share is failing. What should I do? =

Ensure that the API key is correct and the Brand Site is reachable. To do this you can go to OneMedia → Settings on the Governing Site and click the "Edit" button next to the Brand Site. Add a `/` after the URL and click on "Update Site". If the connection has any issues, a relevant error message will be displayed.

= Does this work for Multisite and Non-Multisite? =

Yes, OneMedia supports Subdirectory multisite and standard WordPress installations. As of now, Subdomain multisite installations have not been fully tested.

= Accidentally set incorrect site type during activation. How to fix? =

Uninstall the plugin and then reinstall it. During reactivation, select the correct site type.
Note: Uninstalling the plugin will remove all OneMedia data and settings but the media files will remain intact.

= Is this secure? =

Yes, all site-to-site communication uses API key authentication and validated requests.
